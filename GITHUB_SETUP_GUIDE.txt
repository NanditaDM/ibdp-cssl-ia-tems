HOW TO PUSH YOUR PROJECT TO GITHUB
===================================

I've already initialized Git and made your first commit locally.
Now you need to create a GitHub repository and push to it.

=== STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB ACCOUNT (IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE) ===

1. Go to: https://github.com/
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter your email, password, and username
4. Verify your account
5. Choose the free plan

=== STEP 2: CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY ON GITHUB ===

1. Go to: https://github.com/
2. Click the "+" icon in top-right corner
3. Click "New repository"
4. Repository name: IBDP-CS-IA-TEAMS (or any name you want)
5. Description: "Employee Management System for IBDP CS IA"
6. Choose "Public" (so you can share it) or "Private" (only you can see)
7. DO NOT check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
8. Click "Create repository"

=== STEP 3: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL PROJECT TO GITHUB ===

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

Open Terminal and run these commands:

cd /Users/nanditamahyavanashi/Desktop/IBDP-CS-IA-TEAMS

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IBDP-CS-IA-TEAMS.git

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

REPLACE "YOUR-USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username!

=== STEP 4: ENTER YOUR CREDENTIALS ===

When you push, GitHub will ask for:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (NOT your password!)

To create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "TEAMS-M Project"
4. Select expiration: 90 days (or longer)
5. Check these scopes: "repo" (all checkboxes under repo)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. COPY THE TOKEN - you won't see it again!
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

=== ALTERNATIVE: USE GITHUB DESKTOP (EASIER!) ===

If you don't want to use Terminal:

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "File" > "Add Local Repository"
4. Choose: /Users/nanditamahyavanashi/Desktop/IBDP-CS-IA-TEAMS
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Choose name and public/private
7. Click "Publish"

DONE! Much easier than Terminal.

=== STEP 5: VERIFY IT WORKED ===

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IBDP-CS-IA-TEAMS
2. You should see all your files!
3. Click on any file to view it
4. Your project is now on GitHub!

=== HOW TO UPDATE GITHUB AFTER MAKING CHANGES ===

Every time you edit your code and want to update GitHub:

Option A: Using Terminal
-------------------------
cd /Users/nanditamahyavanashi/Desktop/IBDP-CS-IA-TEAMS
git add .
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"
git push

Option B: Using GitHub Desktop
-------------------------------
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. It will show your changes
3. Type a commit message
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"

=== CURRENT STATUS ===

✓ Git initialized in your project
✓ First commit created with all files
✗ Not yet connected to GitHub (you need to do Steps 2-3 above)

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

Problem: "remote origin already exists"
Solution: git remote remove origin
         Then add it again

Problem: "Authentication failed"
Solution: Use Personal Access Token, not password

Problem: "Permission denied"
Solution: Check if you're logged into correct GitHub account

Problem: "Failed to push"
Solution: Try: git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
         Then: git push origin main

=== WHAT IS GIT? ===

Git = Version control system (tracks changes to your code)
GitHub = Website that hosts Git repositories online

Benefits:
- Backup of your code
- Track changes over time
- Share with others
- Portfolio piece (employers can see your code)
- Required for many coding jobs

=== NEXT STEPS AFTER PUSHING ===

1. Add a nice README.md file to explain your project
2. Add screenshots of your app
3. Share the link with teachers/friends
4. Add it to your resume/portfolio

=== DO YOU WANT ME TO DO THIS FOR YOU? ===

I can't create a GitHub account for you (needs your email/verification),
but I can:
1. Help you with any errors
2. Create a nice README.md file
3. Add proper .gitignore file
4. Set up GitHub Pages (make your app live on the web!)

Just let me know what you need help with!

=== SUMMARY ===

WHAT I DID:
✓ Initialized Git
✓ Created first commit with all files
✓ Project is ready to push

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
1. Create GitHub account (if needed)
2. Create new repository on GitHub
3. Run the git remote add command (replace with your username)
4. Run git push -u origin main
5. Done!

Estimated time: 5-10 minutes
