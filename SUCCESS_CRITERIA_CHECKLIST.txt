=== OOP CONCEPTS ===

✓ Encapsulation
  - All class properties are private (#)
  - Getters and setters for controlled access
  - Files: User.js, Record.js

✓ Inheritance
  - User <- Employee <- Manager
  - User <- HR, IT, CEO
  - Record <- Request, Ticket, Report, etc.
  - Files: User.js, Record.js

✓ Polymorphism
  - Different user types with different capabilities
  - Login method handles different user types
  - File: app.js (login method)

✓ Method Overriding
  - Constructors call parent constructors with super()
  - Files: User.js, Record.js

✓ Libraries of Objects
  - Arrays storing collections: users, requests, tickets, reports, etc.
  - File: app.js (Application class)

✓ Access Modifiers
  - All fields marked as private (#)
  - Public methods for access
  - Files: User.js, Record.js

=== CODE QUALITY ===

✓ Simple code (beginner level)
  - Basic loops (for)
  - Simple conditionals (if/else)
  - No complex algorithms

✓ Short comments
  - Brief, abbreviated comments
  - Indicates locations (e.g., "// getters", "// private")

✓ No undefined references
  - All functions defined before use
  - All variables initialized

✓ Classes used to reduce redundancy
  - Base classes with common functionality
  - Inheritance reduces duplication

✓ Single folder structure
  - All files in same directory
  - Relative imports work correctly
